TouchDesigner is a visual environment to create stunning real time, interactive projects and installations. We invited our resident expert Nathan Van Esbroeck to give a workshop on Touch Designer and show examples of the work he created with the software. We'll design our own interactive installation with a depth camera. The best part: you can do all this without writing a single line of code.
