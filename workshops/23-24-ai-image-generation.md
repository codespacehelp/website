Immerse yourself in the captivating realm of AI-generated images. Discover how AI algorithms have evolved to create stunning visuals, from simplistic sketches to awe-inspiring art pieces. Get introduced to the technologies that make this magic happen, including open-source solutions like Stable Diffusion, and state-of-the-art creative tools like Midjourney and Adobe Firefly.

You will also learn how to guide AI in painting, designing, and creating visuals through effective instructions. Moreover, we'll explore the ethical dimensions of generative AI, discussing issues around bias and representation. Finally, get a glimpse of what the future holdsâ€”AI coming to life through animation and sound!

 In this workshop we will be using [ClipDrop](https://clipdrop.co/), a simple web-based app, and [DreamStudio](https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/), a more advanced tool that requires a free account.

## Goals

- Learn to utilize various tools for generating images for their educational materials such as courses, presentations, and slides.
- Comprehend how different AI image generation models function and how prompt engineering can be used to guide the outcomes.
- Become aware of the ethical implications associated with generative AI, including issues related to bias and representation.

## Requirements

- No prior knowledge in AI or image generation is required.
- Please bring your own laptop for hands-on exercises.

## Next Steps

- Familiarize yourself with basic AI concepts through [this introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ePf9rue1Ao).
- Run AI image generation models on your own machine using [DiffusionBee](https://diffusionbee.com/).
- Learn all about styles and keywords from this [awesome reference](https://github.com/willwulfken/MidJourney-Styles-and-Keywords-Reference).
