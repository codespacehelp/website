In this last part we will introduce JavaScript into the equation. Because JavaScript has so many possibilities, we will only be focussing on the very basics of it: how you can use it to manipulate elements on the page. This will help you get started with your very first programming language.

## Goals

- Learn JavaScriptâ€™s role in websites and web apps.
- An introduction to basic concepts of "computer science": variables, loops, conditions.
- Learn basic programming structures such as variables, functions, arrays etc.
- Learn how JavaScript works with HTML and CSS.
- Learn how to use JavaScript to manipulate page elements on the fly in conjunction with HTML and CSS.
