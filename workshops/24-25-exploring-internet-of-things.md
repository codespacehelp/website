Using IoT (Internet of Things) with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) allows you to connect physical devices to the internet, enabling real-time monitoring and control from anywhere. 

In this workshop, you'll learn how to integrate sensors and actuators with Arduino to gather environmental data, and then send or receive this data over the internet. 

You will also explore how to control devices remotely through web interfaces or cloud services, creating intelligent, connected systems.

## Goals

- Understand the basics of IoT and how Arduino can be used to build IoT systems.
- Learn how to send and receive data from sensors using the internet.
- Introduction to connecting Arduino to cloud services and controlling devices remotely.

## Requirements

This course is for beginners and intermediate students who have no, or very limited, experience with code. Please download the latest version of [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/). Participants should bring their own laptop.

## Project

We will build simple IoT projects, such as using an Arduino to measure light intensity or temperature and sending the data to a cloud service for remote monitoring, or controlling a light or motor over the internet.

We take care of the hardware and components.

## Next Steps

- Browe the [Arduino Playground](https://playground.arduino.cc/) or [Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/)  to see more possibilities and code.
- Have a look at what people do with it at [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/search/?q=iot&projects=all)
