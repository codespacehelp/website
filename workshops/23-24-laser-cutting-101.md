Welcome to the general introduction of our dear machines at codespace. In the morning we will be introducing a 101 on how to work with the laser and 3d printer. In the afternoon we will leave the door open for you to test some files to better understand how the machines work in practice. We will be present so you can ask us any questions during the whole day.

## Goals

- Give students the agency to use the laser machine
- An introduction to basic concepts of "computer science": variables, loops, conditions.
- Learn how to prepare files for Beam pro, the software we use for the laser machine.
