Using physical computing enables you to create systems that interact with the physical world through hardware. By using sensors, you can measure various environmental inputs like motion, temperature, light, or sound.

This workshop will introduce you to capturing these inputs, processing them through a microcontroller like [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), and generating responses like lights, sounds, or movements.

## Goals

- Understand how sensors and actuators function in physical computing.
- Learn basic communication protocols between microcontrollers and computers.
- Gain introductory knowledge of programming a microcontroller using the Arduino environment.

## Requirements

This course is for beginners and intermediate students who have no, or very limited, experience with code. Please download the latest version of [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/). Participants should bring their own laptop.

## Project

We will work on simple projects using an Arduino microcontroller, connecting sensors to measure inputs and creating outputs such as the control over LED displays or motors.
We take care of the hardware and components.

## Next Steps

- Browe the [Arduino Playground](https://playground.arduino.cc/) or [Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/) to see more possibilities and code.
- Have a look at what people do with it at [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/)
