Using [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/) for synthesis allows you to create and manipulate sounds through live coding.

In this workshop, you'll explore how to use Sonic Pi to generate complex soundscapes, beats, and melodies by writing simple lines of code.

Weâ€™ll cover the basics of sound synthesis, rhythm creation, and how to modify parameters like frequency, amplitude, and effects to craft dynamic musical compositions in real-time.

## Goals

- Understand the fundamentals of sound synthesis and how it works in Sonic Pi.
- Learn how to create, layer, and manipulate sounds using basic programming concepts.
- Gain insight into live coding for music performance and sound design.

## Requirements

This course is for beginners and intermediate students who have no, or very limited, experience with code. Please download the latest version of [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/). Participants should bring their own laptop.

## Project

We'll create a variety of sounds from scratch using oscillators, envelopes, and filters, and combine them into musical patterns. Participants will also experiment with live coding to generate interactive music sequences.
