Using physical computing allows you to communicate with the world around you through hardware. Sensors can measure human input, meteorological information or changes in electronic signals coming from changes in energy in the form of light, sound or heat.
The workshop will be an introduction in how to interpret these signals from sensors and convert that data by means of small computers, microcontrollers. Finally we will find out how to establish communication between them and other computers.

## Goals

- Gain insight in the world of sensors, actuators and microcomputers
- Learn about communication protocols between computers
- Introduction into programming a microcomputer using a visual programming language.

## Requirements

Students need to have an account for the [MakeCode / micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/).

## Project

We will make a few simple projects using a [BBC micro:bit](https://www.microbit.org/) - a microcontroller that can be programmed with a visual programming language.

## Next Steps

- Explore [IFTT](https://ifttt.com/) to see how you can trigger physical hardware based on virtual events.
- Learn coding in Arduino with [FreeCodeCamp's Arduino Course for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-your-own-electronics-with-arduino-full-course/).
