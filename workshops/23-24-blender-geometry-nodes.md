By using geometry and shader nodes it's possible to generate a lot of variations of different materials, motion and shapes.

We're super excited to be hosting a workshop with Kris Meeusen, a digital artist and designer from Antwerp, Belgium. Kris has been creating digital, interactive installations for more than 10 years. Kris also shares his knowledge and passion as a teacher of interaction design at the Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp.

You can find some of Kris' work on his [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zuppaman/).

## Goals

- Learn the basics of "parametric modeling" — not using a fully modeled object, but using a set of rules to generate a model.
- Learn how to use instancing — starting from a basic object, then adding tons of complexity to it.
- Quickly iterate on your design ideas by helping the system guide your creative process.
- Understand how to light, composite and render a geometry nodes animation.

## Requirements

- We expect people to have a basic understanding of Blender; either because you followed our [Blender introduction workshop](/workshops/23-24-intro-to-blender/), or followed online tutorials on your own — like the [Blender Donut Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjEaoINr3zgFX8ZsChQVQsuDSjEqdWMAD).
- Please bring your own laptop for hands-on exercises.

## Next Steps

There are tons of good resources on Geometry Nodes. Look at the following YouTube/Vimeo channels:
