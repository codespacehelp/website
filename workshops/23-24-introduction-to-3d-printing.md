Welcome to the general introduction to our machines here at Code Space! In the morning, we'll provide a 101 on working with both the 3D printer and the laser printer. In the afternoon, we'll keep the door open for you to experiment with some files, helping you gain a hands-on understanding of how these machines operate. We'll be available throughout the day to answer any questions you may have.

## Goals

- Give students the agency to use the two machines

- Learn how to trouble shoot some common mistakes

- Learn to prepare files for the machines
