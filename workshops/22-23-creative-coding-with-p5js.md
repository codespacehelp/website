Dip your toes in the ocean of possibilities with creative coding in this workshop. Whether you've never programmed before, or have programmed and need a refresher, this creative coding workshop is for you. We'll teach you the basics of programming with a very visual approach, focused on creating creative results.

Step by step we'll introduce programming concepts like loops, conditions, variables and functions. We'll look at using coding to generate images, animations and interactivity. We'll mostly use [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) as our coding tool.

Throughout this course we'll use the web as our "creative canvas", allowing our creations to be easily uploaded and shared. At the end of the course you'll have an understanding of what you can do with coding, and the tools and resources to continue your journey. You'll have created a mini website with your creations and put it online.

## Goals

- Learn on how to use the web as a creative canvas for generative drawing, animation and interactivity.
- Learn the basics of programming needed for creative coding: loops, variables, conditions.
- Learn how to import data from online apiâ€™s to work with realtime data.
- Learn how to upload and share your work by putting it online.

## Requirements

This course is for beginners who are new to programming and web design. Please install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Chrome](https://google.com/chrome) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox).

## Project

We will follow a number of applications based on the [Generative Gestaltung](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/) book. In addition, we'll make a beat sequencer and a mini game. You'll have created a mini website with your creations and put it online.

## Next Steps

We're organising a beyond the basics course that takes you further along the path to creative coding guru. Also, we really recommend Dan Shiffman's [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/thecodingtrain) series on YouTube.
