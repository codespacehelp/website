Get to know the laser cutter at Sint Lucas / Code Space: the awesome [Beambox Pro](https://www.fluxlasers.com/products/beambox-pro/). With it you can cut and engrave in wood (full wood or MDF), paper/cardboard, leather, fabric and acrylic. Â More information can be found here:

[Beambox Pro Information](https://www.fluxlasers.com/products/beambox-pro/)

The workshop consists of two parts:

 - **Morning (10:00-12:30)**: We will go through the basics of laser, cutting and engraving, and the Beam Studio software.
 - **Afternoon (14:00-17:00)**: You can bring your own design and we will help you cut or engrave it. We provide the wood! (MDF 3mm)

## Goals

- Understand the principles of laser cutting.
- Get to know the Beam Studio software.
- Grasp the safety concepts around laser cutting.
- Be able to distinguish between cutting and engraving and know when to apply which.

## Requirements

Bring your own design (vector or bitmap) if you want to cut something. We expect a number of students, so make your design small enough (ideally less than 10x10cm).

## Costs

Students are required to pay for the available MDF material used in their projects. Of course, you're free to bring your own material.

## Next Steps

- Watch an introduction on [laser cutting / engraving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdACSB8GH3Y).
- Understand the [Beam Studio software](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL97IZXQ17KZ-E4Hz-AmUcVMxzaK7F1izy).
- Check out the [Fablab of the KdG in Hoboken](https://fablabkdg.be/), where they have a large-format laser cutter in addition to other digital fabrication tools.
