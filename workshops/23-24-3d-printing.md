Dive into the exciting world of 3-D printing using the [Ultimaker 2](https://ultimaker.com/3d-printers/s-series/ultimaker-2-connect/). You'll have the opportunity to create 3-D objects using PLA material, ideal for prototypes, educational models, and more. 

The workshop consists of two parts:

 - **Morning Session (10:00-12:30)**: We will cover the fundamentals of 3-D printing, including an introduction to 3D design, how the Ultimaker S2 works, and the basics of slicing software.
- **Afternoon Session (14:00-17:00)**: You'll get hands-on experience by bringing your own design to print. Please note that the cost of PLA material will be your responsibility.

## Goals

- Comprehend the mechanics of 3D printing.
- Understand how to prepare a model for 3D printing.
- Familiarize yourself with the [Cura slicing software](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/).
- Understand safety protocols involved in 3D printing.
- Gain practical skills in setting up a print job.

## Requirements

If you wish to print your design, bring it in a format compatible with slicing software (STL, OBJ, etc.). Due to time constraints and the number of participants, your design should ideally be small enough to complete within the workshop time (e.g., less than 10x10x10cm).

## Costs

Students are required to pay for the PLA material used in their projects.


## Next Steps

- Watch an introduction on [3D printing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m12bX1eEVDM).
- Understand the [Cura software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHJSz4V7DJk).
- Check out the [Fablab of the KdG in Hoboken](https://fablabkdg.be/), where they have a large-format laser cutter in addition to other digital fabrication tools.
