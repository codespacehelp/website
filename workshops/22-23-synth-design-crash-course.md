_We're very happy to host a guest workshop by Roey Tsemah, founder of the [Synthux Academy](https://www.synthux.academy/), a community of DIY musicians and synth designers._

This is a hands-on workshop on synth design and development using the [Simple Synth DIY kit](https://www.synthux.academy/simple) and [Daisy Seed](https://www.electro-smith.com/daisy/daisy) microcontroller. Learn how to synthesize, design and program your first synthesizer and continue developing your instrument long after the workshop with video courses and community support.

## Topics

- Fundamentals of sound design with [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/)
- Fundamentals of interface design
- Soldering basics
- Getting started with Arduino synth programming and Daisy Seed

## Requirements

- There is a limited amount of places available for this workshop. If you want to participate, please fill out the form below.
- We don't require special knowledge on electronics or programming.
- If you registered we'll send you a page with preparation instructions. Make sure to do these before the workshop!

## Project

- You'll design and prototype your own synthesizer using the [Simple Synth DIY kit](https://www.synthux.academy/simple) and [Daisy Seed](https://www.electro-smith.com/daisy/daisy) microcontroller.
- We can't provide the kits for free, but you can buy a synth kit for a heavily reduced price after the workshop.
