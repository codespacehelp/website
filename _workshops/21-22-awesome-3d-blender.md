[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is an open-source application for creating 3D animation that is conquering the world: it's used in movies, animations, games, ... It's fast, has a built-in production quality renderer, and can be used to model traditionally, using virtual clay, as a 2D animation tool, or create complex environments using procedural geometry.

Even though it has improved it can be a bit tricky to get started with. This workshop is a starting point for people wanting to dive into Blender. It's aimed at total beginners, showing how to navigate the scene, create simple objects, and learn about lighting, rendering, animation and some more advanced features such as procedural geometry.
