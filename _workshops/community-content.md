Throughout history a lot of artwork has invited participation of the audience, from Gordon Matta-Clark [roasting a pig](https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/dining/21soho.html) and serving it under the Brooklyn Bridge to the [Learning To Love You More](http://learningtoloveyoumore.com/hello/index.php) project by Miranda July and Harrell Fletcher. Digital projects are ripe for collaboration with the audience: they can invite realtime comments, or enable co-creation of digital art through a custom environment shaped by artists and designers. Knowing how to build a website is one thing; understanding how to set it up for online collaboration is another. And how do we handle inappropriate content and abuse?

This workshop shows a simple system that uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to store user's creations and displays them in a gallery. We'll go over creating a simple drawing tool that we will link to the database to store new creations. You'll be able to design a system to keep a record of any data, from text to images to sounds, curate it, and display it to other viewers.

## Goals

- Learn about the different data we can store: text, images, sound, descriptions.
- Learn how to use Firebase to store and retrieve your data.
- Create a simple UI using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) that can create new contributions.
- Moderate submissions that are inappropriate or abusive.

## Requirements

- Ideally you're familiar with web design or have taken our [Introduction to Web Design](/workshops/introduction-to-web-design) course. If not you might want to watch some introductory videos on web design first.
- All the tools we use are free. Go ahead and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and either [Chrome](https://google.com/chrome) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox).
- Make an account at [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) so that we can immediately put our website online.
- You should have a [Google account](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/) that allows you to login to Firebase.

## Project

We'll make a simple participatory drawing tool together where viewers can make new drawings, store them, and view what other people have drawn.

## Next Steps

- Learn more about Firebase by watching their [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/user/Firebase).
- Dive into Vue.js to create dynamic web interfaces. We recommend the free [Introduction to Vue](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/intro-to-vue-3/intro-to-vue3/) course.
- Come talk to us if you want to build a project with Firebase! We can help you think about the internal design of the app.
