The web is no longer just a place for images and video but, thanks to WebGL and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), can become a full-blown 3D metaverse. Even adding a little 3D to your website can make a big impact!

We'll begin with a showcase of what is possible with 3D on the web. We'll then learn how to build a 3D-enabled website from scratch; working with models, lights, cameras; playing with animation and interactivity; learning about materials; and integrating it into a website.

## Goals

- Understand the possibilities and limitations of 3D on the web.
- Build simple scenes with objects, lights and cameras.
- Integrate a 3D scene with your page using scrolling techniques.

## Requirements

This course is for students with a bit of background in HTML/CSS and a little to no background in JavaScript. If you need a refresher, you can watch a recording of our [web introduction course](https://codespace.help/workshops/21-22-introduction-to-web-design).

## Next Steps

Get a recap of the basics in the [official Three.js documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene).

- The ultimate resource for learning Three.js is Bruno Simon's amazing [Three.js journey](https://threejs-journey.com/).
- Look at the projects on the [Three.js homepage](https://threejs.org/) and get inspired!
