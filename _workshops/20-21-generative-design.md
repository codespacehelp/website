“Generative design approach works in imitation of Nature, performing ideas as codes, able to generate endless variations “ — [Celestino Soddu](http://www.generativedesign.com/)

“Generative design is not about designing the building – Its’ about designing the system that builds a building.” – [Lars Hesellgren](http://www.plparchitecture.com/lars-hesselgren.html)

“Generative design is a design method where the output – image, sound, architectural models, animation – is generated by a set of rules or an Algorithm, normally by using a computer program.” - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_design)

This workshop shows the idea and tactics of generative design. The principle itself can be used in a variety of tools. We will use the in-house developed - and well fit - tool [NodeBox Live](https://nodebox.live/) to find out the fundamentals.

## Goals

- Get a brief history and background of generative design.
- Learn about the basics of NodeBox Live: network, nodes, ports, parameters ..
- Learn about some basic functionality: we will focus on the functions needed for GD.
- Create a few simple examples that explain the prinicple and shows [the power of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cluepJ2eIFI).
- Learn how to embed your NodeBox project into your own webpage.

## Requirements

- NodeBox is free to experiment with. Go ahead and create [your account](https://nodebox.live/users/create).

## Project

We'll make several networks that have endless variety as outcome.

## Next Steps

- Go to the library or buy a copy of Flake's [Computational Beauty of Nature: Computer Explorations of Fractals, Chaos, Complex Systems, and Adaptation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/248544.The_Computational_Beauty_of_Nature) or Maeda's [Design by Numbers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/289202.Design_by_Numbers).
- NodeBox is also well equiped for other design approaches. Have a look at more examples in the [tutorial section](https://nodebox.live/tutorial).
- Generative Design is applicable in a lot of contexts. [Fusion 360](https://www.manandmachine.co.uk/how-to-use-generative-design-in-fusion-360/), an 3d modeling and engineering tool also implemented it
