Tired of printed media? Looking for a way to produce objects rather than a poster? This workshop will introduce you to Digital Fabrication and will set your mind to using the facilities of the [FabLab](https://fablabkdg.be/en/). What type of files makes machines like laser cutters, cnc milling machines or 3D printers happy? What can they do for your work and what are the specifics you have to keep in mind. We will learn about different processes (additive, subtractive, experimental) to produce shape and embed them into our own workflow.

## Goals

- Understand different fabrication machines
- Create appropriate files for several machines
- Use dangerous machines with care.
