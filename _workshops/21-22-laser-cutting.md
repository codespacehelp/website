Sint Lucas / Code Space has a new acquisition: its own laser cutter! We could already use the [Fablab of the KdG in Hoboken](https://fablabkdg.be/), but now we have our own medium format laser cutter.

This is the [Beambox Pro](https://www.fluxlasers.com/products/beambox-pro/). With it you can cut and engrave in wood (full wood or MDF), paper/cardboard, leather, fabric and acrylic. Â More information can be found here:

[Beambox Pro Information](https://www.fluxlasers.com/products/beambox-pro/)

We've planned two introduction sessions to start laser cutting:

- Wednesday, May 4, between 14:00-17:00
- Thursday 12 May, between 14:00-17:00

Bring your own design (bitmap or vectors), and then you can already do a test. We provide the wood!

## Goals

- Understand the principles of laser cutting.
- Get to know the Beam Studio software.
- Grasp the safety concepts around laser cutting.
- Be able to distinguish between cutting and engraving and know when to apply which.

## Requirements

Bring your own design (vector or bitmap) if you want to cut something. We expect a number of students, so make your design small enough (ideally less than 10x10cm).

## Next Steps

- Watch an introduction on [laser cutting / engraving](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdACSB8GH3Y).
- Understand the [Beam Studio software](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL97IZXQ17KZ-E4Hz-AmUcVMxzaK7F1izy).
